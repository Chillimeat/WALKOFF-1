Prepackaged Applications
========================

Hello_World
-----------
	The Hello World  app includes various simple actions that are primarily used to test backend development. When developing a new App, use the 'hello_world' app as a reference as it has examples of many things that you may like to do in your new app.


IP_Addr_Utils
-------------
	This is a simple app that will take an IP Range as input and will return an array of inividual IP's within that range. 


NMAP
----
	This is an app that performs various actions associated to an NMAP scan. It can run scans, gather the hosts from a scan, examine XML's (returned from a previous run scan) and determine what OS the host is running. It can convert XML's to json as well as grabbing the ports and hosts from that file.

Power_Shell
-----------
	This is an app that performs actions associated to a Windows machine. It can run commands on the command line or it can execute powershell scripts. In both cases, the app can use a file as input for the command they would like.


SSH
---
	This is an app that executes various commands through an ssh connection. It can run both local and remote commands, as well as being able to sftp files. Similar to the Power_Shell app, this one can also use file input as the script it wishes to run.
	
Walk_Off 
--------
	The Walk_Off app includes various simple actions that are primarily used to test backend development as well as other workflow demonstrations. When developing a new App, use the 'walk_off' app as a reference as it has examples of many things that you may like to do in your new app. It also gives you a way to "connect" and "disconnect" to Walkoff's API as well as any other api you might wish to authenticate with. Other actions have to do with api calls which you can look into at
