Interface Overview:
========================
In this tutorial, we will briefly cover each of the components of the WALKOFF UI.

Workflows:

	This is the home of workflow creation. In order to build your own workflow you can click 'Create new workflow' or if you have a workflow that you exported/developed elsewhere, you can select the 'import workflow' button and find the json document you wish you upload.
