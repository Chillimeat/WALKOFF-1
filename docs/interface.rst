Interface Overview:
========================
In this tutorial, we will briefly cover each of the components of the WALKOFF UI.

Workflows:
	This is the home of workflow creation. In order to build your own workflow you can click 'Create new workflow' or if you have a workflow that you exported/developed elsewhere, you can select the 'import workflow' button and find the json document you wish you upload.

Dashboard:
	This is the home of custom dashboards for WALKOFF. These can be used to provide visualizations, telemetry, etc.

Execution:
	This is the home of execution control. Here you can find the status of Workflows that have begun execution as well as finding the results from said Workflows. 

Globals:
	This is the home of the globals where we can store variables that can be accessed by any workflow at any time.

Scheduler:
	Create and configure schedules for running workflows.

Settings:
	Manage your WALKOFF instance and users.
